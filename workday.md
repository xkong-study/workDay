**1. Self-Introduction (60 seconds)**

Hi, I’m Xiangrui Kong, currently based in Dublin. I have a Master’s degree in Computer Science from Trinity College Dublin and about 3 years of practical software engineering experience.

Most recently I worked at Velocity Global, where I built scalable features for CMS systems using TypeScript, React, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB. Prior to that, I contributed to a growing startup by developing energy data pipelines, cloud-integrated services, and mobile features. I also have strong backend experience from my time at PepsiCo, where I used Java, Spring Boot, and Angular to build enterprise tools.

My experience spans full-stack development, cloud services, and distributed systems. I'm passionate about building reliable developer tools, and I find Workday's mission of helping customers adopt enterprise platforms especially exciting.

**2. Why This Role / Why Workday**

I’m particularly excited about this role because the CDT team is building tools that help customers adopt Workday’s solutions reliably and efficiently.

I’ve worked on internal tools and customer-facing platforms at scale, and the mission of simplifying customer onboarding really resonates with me.

Workday’s culture of putting people first and investing in long-term innovation aligns with my values and growth goals.
