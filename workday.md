**1. Self-Introduction (60 seconds)**

Hi, I’m Xiangrui Kong, a full-stack engineer based in Dublin with a Master’s in Computer Science from Trinity College. Over the past 3 years, I’ve worked across startups and enterprise environments, focusing on internal platforms, backend systems, and cloud services.

At Velocity Global, I built CMS features using React, AWS Lambda, and DynamoDB—one project involved designing a ZIP batch download tool with a custom progress bar, improving user efficiency.

Before that at Energy Elephant, I worked on data pipelines and backend services to forecast energy usage, using Python, Redis, PostgreSQL, and AWS S3. I also helped ship Flutter-based mobile features and set up GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

Earlier, I interned at PepsiCo, building secure enterprise tools with Spring Boot and Angular, and implementing authentication with JWT and OAuth.

I enjoy building scalable systems and developer tools, and I’m excited about Workday’s focus on customer adoption, collaboration, and functional programming.

**2. Why This Role / Why Workday**  

I'm particularly excited about this role because the CDT team is working on tooling that makes customer onboarding and configuration faster and more reliable. I’ve had hands-on experience building internal CMS tools and backend services that streamline operations for end users, so the mission of enabling seamless adoption really speaks to me.

I'm also eager to work in an environment that uses functional programming with Scala. While I haven’t used Scala professionally, I’ve applied FP principles in JavaScript—working with pure functions, immutability, and composition—and I’m excited to deepen that skill set.

Beyond the technical fit, I really appreciate Workday’s emphasis on people-first culture and long-term growth. I’m looking for a place where I can contribute to meaningful systems while growing as an engineer, and Workday feels like that kind of place.
